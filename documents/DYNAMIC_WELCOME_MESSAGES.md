# Dynamic Welcome Messages

## Overview

The welcome messages are now generated dynamically by the MCP server based on the current context, instead of being hardcoded in the chat server. This allows for more personalized and context-aware greetings.

## Implementation

### Admin Welcome Messages

The admin welcome message is generated by `getAdminWelcomeMessage()` in `src/prompts/systemPrompt-admin.js` and adapts based on:

1. **No customer loaded**: "Welcome, Admin. Can I have the customer's mobile number or name so I can better help you?"
2. **Customer loaded**: "Welcome, Admin. I have [Customer Name] loaded. How can I assist you with this customer?"
3. **Appointment loaded**: "Welcome back, Admin. I have an appointment loaded. How can I help you update it?"

### Customer Welcome Messages

The customer welcome message is generated by `getCustomerWelcomeMessage()` in `src/prompts/systemPrompt-customer.js` and adapts based on:

1. **New customer**: "Hello there! How are you doing today? Can I have your mobile number so I can better help you?"
2. **Returning customer**: "Hello [Customer Name]! Welcome back to Rare Beauty. How can I assist you today?"

## Benefits

### ✅ Context-Aware Greetings
- Messages adapt based on what information is already available
- More personalized experience for both admins and customers
- Clearer next steps based on current state

### ✅ Centralized Message Logic
- Welcome messages are defined in the same place as system prompts
- Easy to update and maintain
- Consistent with the overall prompt strategy

### ✅ No More Hardcoded Messages
- Frontend no longer needs to know about specific welcome message logic
- Messages can include dynamic information (dates, customer names, etc.)
- Reduces coupling between frontend and backend logic

### ✅ Better User Experience
- Admins immediately know if they can search by name or need phone number
- Customers get personalized greetings when returning
- Clear indication of system state (appointment loaded, customer loaded, etc.)

## Technical Details

### Server Implementation

Both `server.js` and `src/index.js` have been updated to use the dynamic welcome message functions:

```javascript
// Generate welcome message dynamically based on context
let welcomeMessage;
if (isAdmin) {
  const { getAdminWelcomeMessage } = require('./src/prompts/systemPrompt-admin');
  welcomeMessage = getAdminWelcomeMessage(context, dateInfo);
} else {
  const { getCustomerWelcomeMessage } = require('./src/prompts/systemPrompt-customer');
  welcomeMessage = getCustomerWelcomeMessage(context, dateInfo);
}
```

### Function Signatures

```javascript
function getAdminWelcomeMessage(context = {}, dateInfo)
function getCustomerWelcomeMessage(context = {}, dateInfo)
```

Where:
- `context`: The MCP context object containing memory, user_info, etc.
- `dateInfo`: Date information object with formattedDate and todayStatus

### Context Structure

The functions examine these context properties:

```javascript
// For admin messages
context.memory?.user_info?.name          // Customer name if loaded
context.memory?.current_appointment_id   // Appointment ID if loaded

// For customer messages  
context.memory?.user_info?.name          // Customer name if returning
```

## Testing

Run the test script to verify all scenarios work correctly:

```bash
node test-dynamic-welcome.js
```

This tests:
- New admin session (no customer)
- Admin with customer loaded
- Admin with appointment loaded
- New customer session
- Returning customer session

## Migration Notes

### Before
- Welcome messages were hardcoded in multiple places
- Frontend had to know about admin vs customer logic
- No personalization based on context

### After
- Welcome messages generated dynamically by MCP server
- Frontend simply requests a welcome message
- Messages personalized based on current state
- Easier to maintain and extend

## Future Enhancements

Potential future improvements:
- Time-based greetings (Good morning, Good afternoon, etc.)
- Service-specific messages when services are pre-selected
- Appointment reminder messages when customer has upcoming appointments
- Holiday/special occasion greetings
