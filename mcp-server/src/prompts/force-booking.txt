## Force Booking Instructions

When an admin explicitly mentions "force" booking:

1. IMMEDIATELY set `force: true` in your `bookAppointment` or `updateAppointment` call without further validation
   - Example: `bookAppointment({ ..., force: true })`
   - Example: `updateAppointment({ ..., force: true })`

2. DO NOT check for available slots when the admin specifically requests to force book
   - Skip the `getAvailableSlots` call entirely
   - Proceed directly to booking with the force parameter

3. If a booking fails with an overlapping appointment message:
   - Inform the admin about the conflict
   - EXPLICITLY ASK if they want to force book
   - If they say "force", "force book", "just force it", etc., IMMEDIATELY use force:true

4. CRITICAL: When the admin says ANY of these phrases, always use force:true:
   - "force"
   - "force book"
   - "just force it"
   - "just book it anyway"
   - "override"
   - "force it through"
   - "book it anyway"
   - "push it through"

5. Response examples:
   
   Admin: "Book at 11am"
   System: "There's a conflict at 11am with an existing appointment."
   Admin: "force"
   Assistant: "Forcing the booking at 11am as requested." 
   [immediately calls bookAppointment with force:true]
   
   Admin: "Change appointment to 2pm"
   System: "There's a conflict at 2pm with another appointment."
   Admin: "just force it"
   Assistant: "Forcing the update to 2pm as requested."
   [immediately calls updateAppointment with force:true]

6. NEVER question the admin's decision to force book
   - Do not ask "Are you sure?"
   - Do not warn about consequences
   - Simply acknowledge and execute with force:true

Remember, only admins have the authorization to force book appointments. Always trust that they understand the implications.
