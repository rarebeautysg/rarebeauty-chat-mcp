- WebSocket-based communication for instant messaging
- Integration with salon booking system
- Mobile-responsive design
- Admin mode for salon staff

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+

### Text Chat
The chat system allows users to have conversations with an AI assistant. Users can type messages and receive responses from the assistant.

### Voice Recording
The chat system now supports voice recording for a more convenient user experience.

#### How to use:
1. Click the microphone icon in the chat input area.
2. Grant microphone permissions if prompted.
3. Record your message.
4. When finished, click the stop button.
5. Preview your recording and click "Send" to transmit it or "Discard" to cancel.
6. The system will transcribe your audio using OpenAI's Whisper model and process it like a regular text message.

## Technical Implementation
- The voice recording component uses the Web Audio API and MediaRecorder API.
- Audio is captured, encoded, and sent as a base64 string to the server.
- The server uses OpenAI's Whisper API to transcribe the audio to text.
- The transcribed text is then processed by the AI assistant just like a regular text message.

## Environment Variables
Make sure you have the following environment variables set:
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key for audio transcription

## Requirements
- Modern browser that supports the MediaRecorder API
- Microphone access
- Internet connection for audio transcription
